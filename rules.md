# Oregon Trail Race

These are completely alternate rules for the Oregon Trail card game which significantly improve its playability.  With these rules it is a competitive, rather than a cooperative, game and  involves a little more strategy, though there is still a fair amount of chance in the gameplay.  These new set of rules work with the supplies in the original game.

The only thing that needs to be added are player markers.  So, grab your Monopoly set or any other game and borrow some player markers.  Anything that is not larger than half the size of the cards and is unique for each player will work.

Each player is driving their own separate wagon on their own trail to Oregon.  Each player starts with 4 virtual people in their wagon.  If all your people die, you are out of the game.  The first player to successfully navigate their wagon to Oregon (and mend any calamities) wins.  The length of the road to Oregon can be adjusted to make the game longer or shorter.  20 to 25 trail segments is a good number, just agree ahead of time.

## Set Up

Put Independence, MO at one end of the table, and Willamette Valley, OR at the other end and place all the player markers on the Independence, MO card.  Place the cards perpendicular to the direction of play.

Supply cards should be shuffled and set up as the supply deck, trail cards as the trail deck, and calamity cards as the calamity deck.

Each player is dealt 5 trail cards and a number of supply cards.
   * 5+ players: 3 supply cards each
   * 3-4 players: 4 supply cards each
   * 2 players: 6 supply cards each

Use the tombstone card and pen to track stats for each player, such as the number of virtual people left alive in their wagon and the number of turns they have to resolve a calamity.  This score keeping can require a little bit of focus (especially when someone has 8 turns to do something) so it generally makes sense to have one person be the score keeper and be responsible for keeping track of counting down these various counters.

## On Your Turn

Each player plays their own trail in parallel to the other players.  The only exception is Town and Fort cards which are laid down sideways and are part of every player's trail (all players get to use the Town / Fort), more on that later.  On your turn, you may do ONE of the following actions:
   * Scout the road ahead -- draw a trail card
   * Forge a new trail -- play a trail card
   * Mend a calamity -- play a supply card
   * Move backwards along your trail by one card
   * Move forwards along your already forged trail by one card
When in a Town / Fort you may additionally:
   * Mend Any Calamity (without using supply cards)
   * Buy Supplies

### Scouting the Road Ahead

There is no hand limit for trail cards, you can collect as many as you want, but it takes one turn to collect each one and this is a race!  So, while you don't want to spend too much time collecting trail cards, having a good arsenal of trail cards to choose from can be an advantage.  When taking this action you simply draw another trail card from the deck into your hand and that is the end of your turn.

### Forging a New Trail

As long as you are at the front of your current trail and have a working wagon with live oxen, you can lay down a new trail card.  The trail cards must match up, and can be turned either direction to make this happen.

When you place a new trail card, your marker automatically moves to the front of it, unless it is a river card.  There are four kinds of trail cards: plain trail cards, river cards, calamity cards, and forts or towns.

#### River Cards

When playing a river card, you must ford the river.  Place your marker on the rear part of the card (before crossing the river) and roll the dice to attempt to ford the river.  Follow the directions on the card.  You make your first attempt on the turn in which you play the card.  If you succeed, then move your marker across the river to the front of the card.  If you do not succeed, then you are stuck in the river and remain on the rear of the card until your next turn when you must attempt to ford the river again as your action on that turn.  You are stuck in the river until you ford it; you cannot take any other action until you do.  You cannot even travel back along your trail or use the "Mend Any Calamity" action.

Calamities that allow you to attempt to instantly mend them (or avoid them) you can still do, you just cannot use your action on your turn to mend a calamity.  For example, if a "Broken Tongue" calamity is played on you, you still roll the dice and potentially avoid the calamity; and if the "Measles" calamity is played on you, you can still discard a medicine card and avoid the calamity.  But, if you don't avoid the calamity then you receive it and must ford the river before you can do anything about it (or you lose a turn before you can return to attempting to ford the river in the case of Measles).  This can be very dangerous; be careful with your river crossings -- especially when you are likely to have calamities played on you.

#### Calamity Cards

When playing a calamity card, you select another player to receive the calamity.  Pick the player before the calamity card is revealed.  See the calamity details section for details on each specific calamity card.

When calamities that say you have "X rounds of play" to resolve the calamity before some consequence happens, you have X turns times the number of virtual people in your wagon.  You start the game with 4, and you lose one whenever a calamity says that you have died.  Some calamities kill instantly, some kill when left un-treated for too long.  You can also loose people when fording rivers.  So, when you are told, "two rounds of play without a food card and you have died of starvation" and you have a full 4 virtual people in your wagon then you have 8 turns to mend that calamity or else your people count goes down to 3.  If you only have one virtual person left in your wagon, you only have 2 turns and if you don't mend it, you are out of the game because all your people have died.  So, the advantage of having more people in your wagon is that it gives you more time to deal with calamities.

When calamities say that you lose a turn (such as "Broken Arm" or "Measles") you lose only the number of turns specified, it is not multiplied by the number of people in your wagon.  But, those lost turns still count against the count-down of any other active calamities on you.

When calamities say that you die if the other, matching calamity card comes up (such as Cholera) then if the second card gets played on another player while you still have not mended yours then you each loose a virtual wagon member.  If the other, matching card gets played on you, then you lose two virtual wagon members.

The "hunting" calamity has no ill effect and allows you to trade a bullets supply card for a food supply card if you have a bullets supply card and want to do that.  If so, look through the supply discard pile, or failing that the deck, for a food card and then re-shuffle the supply deck if you looked through it.  The "thief" calamity allows the person that played the calamity on you to steal a supply card from you.  You hold up your supply cards and they randomly draw one, unless you have the bullets supply card.  If you have bullets you can instead discard the bullets and the thief does not draw a card from you.

#### Forts / Towns

Forts and Towns both work exactly the same in this game, despite the fact that they say different things on them.  In all manners, treat them the same.  When you play a fort / town, you place it perpendicular to the trail.  It can be played on any position of trail card and any sort of trail card can be played out of it.  You place it perpendicular because it becomes a part of everyone's trail.  For discovering the town, you receive two free supply cards.  Everyone else that arrives in the town gets one free supply card.  Besides the special "Mend Any Calamity" action that can only be taken when in a town, the free supply card(s) are the other advantage of the town.

If other players are ahead of your trail when you play the town, then you simply slide their trail cards apart at the point of the town so that it becomes a part of their trail.  They are now one step closer to Oregon.  They can make use of the calamity mending features of the town if they want to come back to it, but they do not get a free supply card.  So, it is only the people that are behind you that also get a free supply card in a town that you play.

Once other players have forged a trail up to your town they have an option, they can step into the town as the action of their turn (and receive a free supply card) or they can choose to skip the town and go from their trail before the town to the next trail card they forge right after the town without spending a turn to stop in the town.  But, in this case, they are forfeiting their free supply card.  Either way, the trail card after the town does not have to match up with the trail card before the town.

When a town (or fort) is played, count up how many players are behind the town, including yourself, and add one to it.  This is the number of supply cards the town will give out for free (if nobody skips the town).  Draw this number of supplies off the supply deck and place them by the town.  You look at the supply cards and select the two that you want to take.  As each other player reaches the town, they look at the supply cards left by the town and pick the one they want.  So, the more people behind the town, the greater a selection of supplies you will be able to choose from, but also the more players will get a free supply.  Also, arriving at the town sooner than other players has an advantage in that you have a better selection of the remaining supplies in the town.  Once the last player has reached or passed the town, any left over supplies from players skipping the town are discarded.

### Mending Calamities

For calamities that can be mended by supply cards, you can play those supply cards as the action on your turn.  The calamity card is placed in a calamity discard pile, and the supply cards are placed in a supply discard pile.  (Some calamities require multiple supply cards.)

#### Trading Supplies

If you do not have the needed supply for a calamity, you can attempt to "trade" one of your supply cards for the needed supply.  To do this, roll the die.  If you roll an even number then the trade is successful and you can mend the calamity.  You don't actually have to go find the supply card you are trading for, you just discard the traded supply as if it were that supply.  You can only do this when mending a calamity.  If you roll an odd number, then the trade has failed and you lose the supply.  In this case discard only the supply card you were trying to trade; it is lost and you still have the calamity.  But, your turn is not spent.  You can attempt to trade again (as long as you have supplies to trade) or take a different action instead.  Any time you need to use a supply you can attempt to substitute a different supply by "trading." (For example, you can trade to try to get Medicine to avoid the Measles, even when it isn't your turn and the calamity is being played on you.)

In the case of calamities that require two supply cards to mend, if you are trading for one of the supplies, you only loose that one supply you are trading if the trade fails, you keep the other supply.  If you need to trade for both supplies needed, you only roll the die once.  Both supply trades either succeed or fail together.

If you fail to mend the calamity by trading, you can try again on the same turn, as long as you have supplies to attempt to trade.

### Mend Any Calamity

When in a fort or town (including Independence and Willamette Valley) you can mend any calamity at the cost of only your turn.  No supply cards are spent, you simply discard the calamity as the action of that turn.  The only constraint is that your player marker must be in a fort or town.  This can be used to mend absolutely any calamity except calamities that have already taken their effect on you.  For example, the Dysentery calamity instantly kills a member of your wagon.  Even if you are in a town, you cannot do anything about it.

### Buying Supplies

When in a fort or town (including Independence and Willamette Valley) you can draw a supply card from the supply deck and add it to your hand.  The only cost is the turn that you spent doing this.  This can be done as many times as you want, even if you travelled back to the town to do it.  The supplies are drawn randomly from the supply deck, not from the set aside collection of free supplies at the town.

### Moving on Your Trail

As long as you are not stuck in the middle of fording a river, you can move backwards along the trail you have created, and then move forward again to the front of your trail.  Each step requires one turn.  You can do this even if your wagon is broken or your oxen are dead.  In other words, you can do this even if you are not in a condition to forge new trail segments.

This is why when you first play a river card, you put your marker on the back half of the card.  This indicates that you are in the middle of fording the river and cannot take any other action.  Once you ford the river, you put your marker on the front half of the card.  When moving backward and forward along your trail, you always place your marker on the front half of the card you are moving to.  You do not have to re-ford any rivers in your trail.  You only have to ford the river when you are first forging that section of the trail.

At a cost of one turn for each step both backwards and forwards, this is an expensive action given that you are in a race.  But, if your wagon breaks down out on the trail and you have no supplies to fix it, your only choice may be to hope that you are able to walk back to that last town and get help.  Note, that you can mend a calamity such as a broken wagon in a fort / town even if you had to walk back to the town and the wagon is theoretically broken down at the end of your trail.  The calamity is fixed the moment you fix it in town, not once you walk back to the wagon.  But, if you are low on wagon members, or are very far from the last town, you may be in a situation where you are doomed.  Even if you have a fort / town in your hand, you can't forge new trail to play that town when you have a broken wagon, and you will need a turn for each trail segment you have to go back along to get to a fort / town plus one more turn to use the "Mend Any Calamity" action.

# Replenishing the Decks

Especially with lots of players the trail and supply cards can run low pretty quickly.  The calamity and supply decks should be replenished by shuffling the discard piles to recreate the decks.  You should wait until the decks are completely empty, unless you need to draw multiple supplies (like when creating a supply stock at a town / fort).  If you need to draw more supplies than the supply deck has, then combine the remaining cards of the deck with the discard pile, shuffle into the new deck and then draw the cards you need.

Trail cards need to be collected by shifting the trails back and picking up the played trail cards once all players have passed that point in the trail and will not be returning to them.  The best way to do this is to trim the trail laid before a town once all players have passed the town.  There's no reason for anyone to travel back before the town, so you can collect up those trail cards and place them in a trail discard pile.  Make sure to note down how long a trail you have taken up so you remember what distance you have travelled.  Don't place the trail cards back into the trail deck until it is empty.  Then, reshuffle the discarded trail cards to recreate a trail deck.

# Ending the Game

If all the virtual people in your wagon die, then you are out of the game.

To win you must get to Oregon and have no active calamities.  If you get there with calamities, you have to take the necessary number of turns using the "Mend Any Calamity" action to mend them before you can claim victory.  You win the race!

How long a trail it takes to get to Oregon can be adjusted for length of game, but 20 trail cards is a good starting point.  When counting the length of trail, towns and forts do not count in the length.

On any turn after that, you can mend the calamity with a medicine supply or by using the "Mend Any Calamity" action at a fort / town.  If the other Measles card is played on any player before you have mended this one, then you lose a person from your wagon, and the other player that just received the second Measles card (whether that is you or another player) also loses a person from their wagon unless they successfully deflect the calamity with a medicine card (or trading for a medicine card). | ![]()
![]() | *Typhoid*<br>You have as many turns after receiving this calamity as there are people in your wagon to mend it.  If you do not, you lose one of the people in your wagon.
