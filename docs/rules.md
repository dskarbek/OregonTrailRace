# Set Up

Put Independence, MO at one end of the table, and Willamette Valley, OR at the other end.
Place the cards perpendicular to the direction of play.

Supply cards should be set up as a bank. Each kind in its own stack, face up. 
Trail cards are shuffled and set face down in a stack as the trail deck, and calamity cards likewise as the calamity deck.

Deal 5 trail cards to each player.
Determine who will go first and then take turns selecting supplies to start with in reverse of the play order.
Whoever will be going last draws one supply first, then on counter-clockwise to the next to last player, each drawing one supply.
Go around in this reverse order enough times for everyone to draw the proper number of supply cards. 
   * 5+ players: 3 supply cards each
   * 3-4 players: 4 supply cards each
   * 2 players: 6 supply cards each

![Setup]

Use the tombstone card and pen to track how many people are in each person's wagon, and when you start recycling old
parts of the trail to remember how many trail segments have been removed from each person's trail.

# On Your Turn

Each player plays their own trail in parallel to the other players.
![][parallel_play]

The only exception is Town and Fort cards which are laid down sideways and are part of every player's trail (all players 
get to use the Town / Fort), more on that later.
![][town]

On your turn, you take as many actions as you have people in your wagon.
The possible actions are:
   * Scout the road ahead -- draw a trail card (no hand limit)
   * Forge a new trail -- play a trail card or attempt to ford a river (you have to ford the rivers, but you pick someone else to suffer the calamities)
   * Mend a calamity -- play a supply card (or two if needed to mend one calamity)
   * Move backwards along your trail by one card (flip the card over)
   * Move forwards along your already forged trail by one card (flip the card back over, don't redo rivers or calamities, just flip back over)
   * Use a fort or town, either one that you are at, or putting one in your hand where you are.

# Ending the Game

If all the virtual people in your wagon die, then you are out of the game.

First person to reach Oregon wins.  This is done when the 20th trail card is forged.
In counting 20 trail segments, the forts and towns do not count.
Make sure you don't count them when purging old trail cards.

How long a trail it takes to get to Oregon can be adjusted for desired length of game.
20 trail cards is a good starting point and typically results in an hour long game for experienced players.
For a first game, you could do just 10 trail cards.  That would keep it short and allow you to get familiar with the game.

That's the basics of the game.  Following are more details on how each part works.

# Replenishing the Decks

The supply bank gets refreshed with supplies that are lost in rivers or that are used in mending calamities.
At any point if the supply bank doesn't have the supply you want, or any supplies, you are simply out of luck.
You do not get "IOU"s from the bank.

As calamity cards are used and either mended or completed they are discarded.
Once the calamity deck runs empty, shuffle the discard pile to re-create the deck.
Wait until the deck is empty to do this.

Especially with lots of players the trail cards can run low pretty quickly.

Trail cards need to be collected by shifting the trails back and picking up the played trail cards once all players have passed that point in the trail and will not be returning to them.
The best way to do this is to trim the trail laid before a town or fort once all players have passed it.
There's no reason for anyone to travel back before the town, so you can collect up those trail cards and place them in a trail discard pile.
Make sure to note down how long a trail you have taken up so you remember what distance you have travelled.
Also, you can't travel backwards along your trail more than 4 steps, so you can pick up trail cards beyond that.
Town and Fort cards are collected along with the trail that leads out of them.
Don't place the trail cards back into the trail deck until it is empty.
Then, reshuffle the discarded trail cards to recreate a trail deck.
When picking up the trail cards, keep count of how long a trail (not counting forts/towns) has been picked up so you can still count what trail length each player has reached.

Here, everyone has gotten past the town...
![][past_town]

So, we can prune the trail from before the town...
![][pruning_trail]

And, then shift the remaining cards down to make room.

# Forging a New Trail

As long as you are at the front of your current trail and have a working wagon with live oxen, you can lay down a new trail card.
The trail cards must match up, and can be turned either direction to make this happen.
The only exception is that the trail cards on either side of a fort or town do not have to match up.

River cards are placed sideways to show that you are stuck in the river until you ford it.
You get one free attempt at fording the river when you play it.
Once the river is forded, turn it to match up with the trail to show that it has been forded.
Until you successfully ford a river, you can't forge more trail, move backwards along your trail, or play a town / fort card to use.
You are stuck in the river. You can still mend calamities.
Each attempt (after the first one) at fording the river costs an action.

The river cards say on them how they must be forded.  It's always "roll an even number to successfully ford the river."
Most cards say that if you roll an odd number you lose a supply (pick one to put back in the bank).
Some river cards don't cost you supplies, but can cause your people to drown.  For these, if you roll a one then you lose a wagon member.
On 3 and 5 there is simply no negative effect other than still being stuck in the river.
If a wagon member drowns in the river then it is on your next turn that you have one fewer action, you don't lose an action on your current turn, because it was that attempt to ford the river that is the lost action.

When you play a trail card that causes a calamity, you pick which player will receive the calamity and then draw it.
See the [calamity details] for specifics on the play of each calamity.
It is basically what is printed on the card, but realize that "one round of play" means "one turn" of however many or few actions you have.
You can always remove any calamity from in front of you by choosing that option when using a town.

The thief calamity allows the person playing the calamity to randomly choose a supply card from the player they had choosen for the calamity (note that you choose the victim before finding out what the calamity is).
But, if the victim of thieving has bullets, they can discard those and turn the direction of thieving around.

The descriptions on the calamity cards are not always completely clear, especially in the context of these alternate rules, so refer to the [calamity details] for more info.

# Forts and Towns

When your last played trail card (or last face up one in the case of moving backwards) is right before a fort or town you can use the behavior listed on the card as an action.
If you have a fort or town card in your hand, you can place it on your tail at any point to use it.  You place and use the behavior as a single action.
When a fort or town is placed, it is placed perpendicular to the trails and in the middle of all of them.  It can be used by all players at that point in their trail.

You do not have to use a town or fort when you are passing by it.
If someone else has played it ahead of your trail, when your trail reaches it you can use an action to use the town / fort, or just keep forging your trail.
Either way, your trails do not have to match up on either side of the town / fort.

The benefit for a fort is that you get to pick 2 supply cards from the bank.
If the bank is short on supplies then you simply don't get them. You are not owed them.

The benefit for a town is a choice between 1 supply card and removing a calamity.
Each time you exercise the action of the town you can pick a different benefit.
For the supply, simply pick an available one from the bank -- similar to with a fort except only 1 supply.
If you chose the calamity mending benefit, simply discard one calamity from in front of you.
It's as if you mended it with supplies, except you can do this even if there is no natural rememdy for the calamity (such as with Inadequate Grass).

# Mending Calamities

For calamities that can be mended by supply cards, you can play those supply cards as an action on your turn to remove the calamity.
The calamity card is placed in a calamity discard pile, and the supply cards are placed back in the supply bank.
Some calamities require multiple supply cards, but they are still mended in one action.
But, multiple calamities do need one action each to mend.

## Trading Supplies

If you do not have the needed supply for a calamity, you can attempt to "trade" one of your supply cards for the needed supply.
To do this, roll the die.
If you roll an even number then the trade is successful and the calamity is mended.
The needed supply does not have to actually exist in the bank, you just discard the traded supply in leu of that supply.
You can only do this when mending a calamity.
If you roll an odd number, then the trade has failed and you lose the supply -- return it to the bank.
But, your action is not spent. You can attempt to trade again (as long as you have supplies to trade) or take a different action instead.

In the case of calamities that require two supply cards to mend, if you are trading for one of the supplies, you only loose that one supply you are trading if the trade fails, you keep the other supply.
If you need to trade for both supplies needed, you only roll the die once.
Both supply trades either succeed or fail together.

If you fail to mend the calamity by trading, it doesn't count as an action.

# Moving on Your Trail

As long as you are not stuck in the middle of fording a river, you can move backwards along the trail you have created, and then move forward again to the front of your trail.
Each step requires one turn.
You can do this even if your wagon is broken or your oxen are dead.
In other words, you can do this even if you are not in a condition to forge new trail segments.

To move backwards along your trail one step, simply turn the trail card over in place so that the back is showing.
To move forwards again, turn the trail card back over to show the trail again.
You do not have to re-ford any rivers in your trail. You also do not get to re-play calamities on people.
You have to do this in order from the tip of your trail on back and then in order back out.
When you turn over the piece of trail just after a fort or town, you are now back at the town and can use its behavior (at the cost of an action of course).
You cannot move more than 4 steps back on your trail.

At a cost of one turn for each step both backwards and forwards, this is an expensive action given that you are in a race.
But, if your wagon breaks down out on the trail and you have no supplies to fix it, your only choice may be to hope that you are able to walk back to that last town and get help.
Note, that you can mend a calamity such as a broken wagon in a town even if you had to walk back to the town and the wagon is theoretically broken down at the end of your trail.
The calamity is fixed the moment you fix it in town, not once you walk back to the wagon.

But, if you are low on wagon members, you may be in a situation where you are doomed.
You need an action to "use the town" or an action to "use the fort" and then a second action to "mend the calamity".
So, if you are more than 2 segments past the fort or 3 segments past a town, you won't have enough actions to save yourself.
Moral of the story is don't get too far out on the trail without a good stock of supplies that you can use (or trade) to mend broken wagons and dead oxen.
If you have a town or fort in your hand, you can place and use it when you have a broken wagon or dead oxen; as long as you aren't stuck in a river.
