## Set Up

Put Independence, MO at one end of the table, and Willamette Valley, OR at the other end and place all the player markers on the Independence, MO card.  Place the cards perpendicular to the direction of play.

Supply cards should be shuffled and set up as the supply deck, trail cards as the trail deck, and calamity cards as the calamity deck.

![Setup]

Each player is dealt 5 trail cards and a number of supply cards.
   * 5+ players: 3 supply cards each
   * 3-4 players: 4 supply cards each
   * 2 players: 6 supply cards each

Use the tombstone card and pen to track stats for each player, such as the number of virtual people left alive in their wagon and the number of turns they have to resolve a calamity.  This score keeping can require a little bit of focus (especially when someone has 8 turns to do something) so it generally makes sense to have one person be the score keeper and be responsible for keeping track of counting down these various counters. For now, write down each player name and mark that they have 4 wagon members in such a way that they can removed one by one.  (Perhaps little stick figures that can be erased, or just circles that can be crossed out.)

Because you are allowed to move back and forth on your trail, it is highly recommended that you have some sort of player marker.  Grab some sort of unique avatar token for each player. If you have the classic game "Life," use the little cars from that as your little wagon avatars and put 4 people in each one. Then you can just pull people out when they die, maybe leave them on the section of trail where they died as a little tombstone to them.

## On Your Turn

Each player plays their own trail in parallel to the other players.
![][parallel_play]

The only exception is Town and Fort cards which are laid down sideways and are part of every player's trail (all players get to use the Town / Fort), more on that later.
![][town]

On your turn, you may do ONE of the following actions:
   * Scout the road ahead -- draw a trail card
   * Forge a new trail -- play a trail card
   * Mend a calamity -- play a supply card
   * Move backwards along your trail by one card
   * Move forwards along your already forged trail by one card
When in a Town / Fort you may additionally:
   * Mend Any Calamity (without using supply cards)
   * Buy Supplies

### Scouting the Road Ahead

There is no hand limit for trail cards, you can collect as many as you want, but it takes one turn to collect each one and this is a race!  So, while you don't want to spend too much time collecting trail cards, having a good arsenal of trail cards to choose from can be an advantage.  When taking this action you simply draw another trail card from the deck into your hand and that is the end of your turn.

### Forging a New Trail

As long as you are at the front of your current trail and have a working wagon with live oxen, you can lay down a new trail card.  The trail cards must match up, and can be turned either direction to make this happen.

When you place a new trail card, your marker automatically moves to the front of it, unless it is a river card. You have to ford the river (taking as many actions / turns as necessary) before you can do any other action.  The calamity cards allow you to play a calamity on someone else.  Forts and towns are available to all trails once played.

### Mending Calamities

For calamities that can be mended by supply cards, you can play those supply cards as the action on your turn.  The calamity card is placed in a calamity discard pile, and the supply cards are placed in a supply discard pile.  (Some calamities require multiple supply cards.)

#### Trading Supplies

If you do not have the needed supply for a calamity, you can attempt to "trade" one of your supply cards for the needed supply.  To do this, roll the die.  If you roll an even number then the trade is successful and you can mend the calamity.  You don't actually have to go find the supply card you are trading for, you just discard the traded supply as if it were that supply.  You can only do this when mending a calamity.  If you roll an odd number, then the trade has failed and you lose the supply.  In this case discard only the supply card you were trying to trade; it is lost and you still have the calamity.  But, your turn is not spent.  You can attempt to trade again (as long as you have supplies to trade) or take a different action instead.  Any time you need to use a supply you can attempt to substitute a different supply by "trading." (For example, you can trade to try to get Medicine to avoid the Measles, even when it isn't your turn and the calamity is being played on you.)

In the case of calamities that require two supply cards to mend, if you are trading for one of the supplies, you only loose that one supply you are trading if the trade fails, you keep the other supply.  If you need to trade for both supplies needed, you only roll the die once.  Both supply trades either succeed or fail together.

If you fail to mend the calamity by trading, you can try again on the same turn, as long as you have supplies to attempt to trade.

### Mend Any Calamity

When in a fort or town (including Independence and Willamette Valley) you can mend any calamity at the cost of only your turn.  No supply cards are spent, you simply discard the calamity as the action of that turn.  The only constraint is that your player marker must be in a fort or town.  This can be used to mend absolutely any calamity except calamities that have already taken their effect on you.  For example, the Dysentery calamity instantly kills a member of your wagon.  Even if you are in a town, you cannot do anything about it.

### Buying Supplies

When in a fort or town (including Independence and Willamette Valley) you can draw a supply card from the supply deck and add it to your hand.  The only cost is the turn that you spent doing this.  This can be done as many times as you want, even if you travelled back to the town to do it.  The supplies are drawn randomly from the supply deck, not from the set aside collection of free supplies at the town.

### Moving on Your Trail

As long as you are not stuck in the middle of fording a river, you can move backwards along the trail you have created, and then move forward again to the front of your trail.  Each step requires one turn.  You can do this even if your wagon is broken or your oxen are dead.  In other words, you can do this even if you are not in a condition to forge new trail segments.

This is why when you first play a river card, you put your marker on the back half of the card.  This indicates that you are in the middle of fording the river and cannot take any other action.  Once you ford the river, you put your marker on the front half of the card.  When moving backward and forward along your trail, you always place your marker on the front half of the card you are moving to.  You do not have to re-ford any rivers in your trail.  You only have to ford the river when you are first forging that section of the trail.

At a cost of one turn for each step both backwards and forwards, this is an expensive action given that you are in a race.  But, if your wagon breaks down out on the trail and you have no supplies to fix it, your only choice may be to hope that you are able to walk back to that last town and get help.  Note, that you can mend a calamity such as a broken wagon in a fort / town even if you had to walk back to the town and the wagon is theoretically broken down at the end of your trail.  The calamity is fixed the moment you fix it in town, not once you walk back to the wagon.  But, if you are low on wagon members, or are very far from the last town, you may be in a situation where you are doomed.  Even if you have a fort / town in your hand, you can't forge new trail to play that town when you have a broken wagon, and you will need a turn for each trail segment you have to go back along to get to a fort / town plus one more turn to use the "Mend Any Calamity" action.

# Replenishing the Decks

Especially with lots of players the trail and supply cards can run low pretty quickly.  The calamity and supply decks should be replenished by shuffling the discard piles to recreate the decks.  You should wait until the decks are completely empty, unless you need to draw multiple supplies (like when creating a supply stock at a town / fort).  If you need to draw more supplies than the supply deck has, then combine the remaining cards of the deck with the discard pile, shuffle into the new deck and then draw the cards you need.

Trail cards need to be collected by shifting the trails back and picking up the played trail cards once all players have passed that point in the trail and will not be returning to them.  The best way to do this is to trim the trail laid before a town once all players have passed the town.  There's no reason for anyone to travel back before the town, so you can collect up those trail cards and place them in a trail discard pile.  Make sure to note down how long a trail you have taken up so you remember what distance you have travelled.  Don't place the trail cards back into the trail deck until it is empty.  Then, reshuffle the discarded trail cards to recreate a trail deck.

Here, everyone has gotten past the town...

So, we can prune the trail from before the town...

And, then shift the remaining cards down to make room.

# Ending the Game

If all the virtual people in your wagon die, then you are out of the game.

To win you must get to Oregon and have no active calamities.  If you get there with calamities, you have to take the necessary number of turns using the "Mend Any Calamity" action to mend them before you can claim victory.  You win the race!

How long a trail it takes to get to Oregon can be adjusted for length of game, but 20 trail cards is a good starting point.  When counting the length of trail, towns and forts do not count in the length.
