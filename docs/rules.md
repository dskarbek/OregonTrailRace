## Set Up

Put Independence, MO at one end of the table, and Willamette Valley, OR at the other end.
Place the cards perpendicular to the direction of play.

Supply cards should be set up as a bank. Each kind in its own stack, face up. 
Trail cards are shuffled and set face down in a stack as the trail deck, and calamity cards likewise as the calamity deck.

Deal 5 trail cards to each player.
Determine who will go first and then take turns selecting supplies to start with in reverse of the play order.
Whoever will be going last draws one supply first, then on counter-clockwise to the next to last player, each drawing one supply.
Go around in this reverse order enough times for everyone to draw the proper number of supply cards. 
   * 5+ players: 3 supply cards each
   * 3-4 players: 4 supply cards each
   * 2 players: 6 supply cards each

![Setup]

Use the tombstone card and pen to track how many people are in each person's wagon, and when you start recycling old
parts of the trail to remember how many trail segments have been removed from each person's trail.

## On Your Turn

Each player plays their own trail in parallel to the other players.
![][parallel_play]

The only exception is Town and Fort cards which are laid down sideways and are part of every player's trail (all players 
get to use the Town / Fort), more on that later.
![][town]

On your turn, you take as many actions as you have people in your wagon.
The possible actions are:
   * Scout the road ahead -- draw a trail card
   * Forge a new trail -- play a trail card (or town/fort)
   * Attempt to ford a river
   * Mend a calamity -- play a supply card (or two if needed to mend one calamity)
   * Move backwards along your trail by one card
   * Move forwards along your already forged trail by one card
   * Repeat the action of a fort / town that you are in

### Scouting the Road Ahead

There is no hand limit for trail cards, you can collect as many as you want, but it takes one action to collect each one and this is a race!
So, while you don't want to spend too much time collecting trail cards, having a good arsenal of trail cards to choose from can be an advantage.
When taking this action you simply draw another trail card from the deck into your hand.

### Forging a New Trail

As long as you are at the front of your current trail and have a working wagon with live oxen, you can lay down a new trail card.
The trail cards must match up, and can be turned either direction to make this happen.

River cards are placed sideways to show that you are stuck in the river until you ford it.
You get one free attempt at fording the river when you play it. (see below)

When you play a trail card that causes a calamity, you pick which player will receive the calamity and then draw it.
See the [calamity details][calamities] for specifics on the play of each calamity.
You can always remove any calamity from in front of you by chosing that option when arriving in a town.

Forts and towns are available to all trails once played.
They can be played on any sort of trail card -- they match all trail positions.
When you arrive in a fort or town, you receive the benefit listed on the card.
This is part of the action that landed you in the town.
If you are the person that played the fort / town then you have arrived in town by playing the card.
If you were past the fort / town when played then moving backwards along your trail causes you to arrive when you move back from the last trail card beyond the town.
If you are not yet to a fort / town that someone else plays, you do NOT arrive in it when you forge your trail up to the point of the town.
As your next action you must choose to "enter" the town and then receive the benefit.
Your other option is to skip the town and continue your trail after the town saving the action that would have been spent entering the town, but also forgoing any benefit from the town (unless you later return to it).
When you have entered a town, the next trail card you play after it does not have to match up with your prior trail, but if you are skipping a town then the trail cards do have to match up.

### Ford a River

If you are stuck in a river, then you must use this action until you succeed. No other action can be used until you do.
You get to take this action once for free when you first play the river.
If you roll an even number then the river is successfully forded, turn it to line the path up with your trail.
If you roll an odd number then you fail to ford the river (and it still counts as taking an action).
Most river cards also bear a consequnce of losing a supply card when you fail to ford it.
Some cause a member of your wagon to die if you rolled a 1, but have no negative effect on a 3 or 5.
Either way, if you fail to ford the river you are still stuck in it and must continue using actions to attempt to ford it.
If you have no supply cards then you can't lose any and simply don't have any negative effect.
In the case of a wagon member dying it doesn't reduce the number of available actions you have until your next turn.
(It's the action you just spent that is lost on the next turn.)


### Mending Calamities

For calamities that can be mended by supply cards, you can play those supply cards as an action on your turn to remove the calamity.
The calamity card is placed in a calamity discard pile, and the supply cards are placed back in the supply bank.
Some calamities require multiple supply cards, but they are still mended in one action.
However each calamity, even if it needs only one supply, each require a separate action to mend.

#### Trading Supplies

If you do not have the needed supply for a calamity, you can attempt to "trade" one of your supply cards for the needed supply.
To do this, roll the die.
If you roll an even number then the trade is successful and you can mend the calamity.
The needed supply does not have to actually exist in the bank, you just discard the traded supply in leu of that supply.
You can only do this when mending a calamity.
If you roll an odd number, then the trade has failed and you lose the supply -- return it to the bank.
But, your action is not spent.
You can attempt to trade again (as long as you have supplies to trade) or take a different action instead.

In the case of calamities that require two supply cards to mend, if you are trading for one of the supplies, you only loose that one supply you are trading if the trade fails, you keep the other supply.
If you need to trade for both supplies needed, you only roll the die once.
Both supply trades either succeed or fail together.

If you fail to mend the calamity by trading, it doesn't count as an action.

### Moving on Your Trail

As long as you are not stuck in the middle of fording a river, you can move backwards along the trail you have created, and then move forward again to the front of your trail.
Each step requires one turn.
You can do this even if your wagon is broken or your oxen are dead.
In other words, you can do this even if you are not in a condition to forge new trail segments.

To move backwards along your trail one step, simply turn the trail card over in place so that the back is showing.
To move forwards again, turn the trail card back over to show the trail again.
You do not have to re-ford any rivers in your trail.
You have to do this in order from the tip of your trail on back and then in order back out.
When you turn over the piece of trail just after a fort or town, you are moving backwards into the town and get the benefit of "arriving" in the town without needing any additional action to "enter" the town.
You cannot move more than 4 steps back on your trail.

At a cost of one turn for each step both backwards and forwards, this is an expensive action given that you are in a race.
But, if your wagon breaks down out on the trail and you have no supplies to fix it, your only choice may be to hope that you are able to walk back to that last town and get help.
Note, that you can mend a calamity such as a broken wagon in a town even if you had to walk back to the town and the wagon is theoretically broken down at the end of your trail.
The calamity is fixed the moment you fix it in town, not once you walk back to the wagon.
But, if you are low on wagon members, or are very far from the last town, you may be in a situation where you are doomed.
Even if you have a town in your hand, remember that placing that town onto the board is a use of the "Forge New Trail" action which you can't use when your wagon is broken or oxen are dead.
You can walk back to a known town, but not "find" a new one.

### Arriving in a Fort or Town

When you first play a fort or town you "arrive" in it for free (you take this action as well as part of the action of playing the town).
When you play trail up to a fort or town you must use an additional action to "enter" it.  You can chose to save the action and by-pass it.
When you walk back your trail to a fort or town, you automatically "arrive" in it again.
You can also repeat the action of arriving in a fort or town when you are already in it as an action.
This means that once you arrive in a town, you can use more actions to repeat the benefit of the town as many times as you want.

The benefit for a fort is that you get to pick 2 supply cards from the bank.
If the bank is short on supplies then you simply don't get them. You are not owed them.

The benefit for a town is a choice between 1 supply card and removing a calamity.
Each time you exercise the action of the town you can pick a different benefit.
For the supply, simply pick an available one from the bank -- similar to with a fort except only 1 supply.
If you chose the calamity mending benefit, simply discard one calamity from in front of you.
It's as if you mended it with supplies, except you can do this even if there is no natural rememdy for the calamity (such as with Inadequate Grass).

# Replenishing the Decks

The supply bank gets refreshed with supplies that are lost in rivers or that are used in mending calamities.
At any point if the supply bank doesn't have the supply you want, or any supplies, you are simply out of luck.
You do not get "IOU"s from the bank.

As calamity cards are used and either mended or completed they are discarded.
Once the calamity deck runs empty, shuffle the discard pile to re-create the deck.
Wait until the deck is empty to do this.

Especially with lots of players the trail cards can run low pretty quickly.

Trail cards need to be collected by shifting the trails back and picking up the played trail cards once all players have passed that point in the trail and will not be returning to them.
The best way to do this is to trim the trail laid before a town once all players have passed the town.
There's no reason for anyone to travel back before the town, so you can collect up those trail cards and place them in a trail discard pile.
Make sure to note down how long a trail you have taken up so you remember what distance you have travelled.
Alternatively, nobody should travel backwards along their trail more than 4 steps, so you can pick up trail cards beyond that.
Town and Fort cards are collected along with the trail that leads out of them.
Don't place the trail cards back into the trail deck until it is empty.
Then, reshuffle the discarded trail cards to recreate a trail deck.
When picking up the trail cards, keep count of how many segments (not counting forts/towns) have been picked up for each player so you know how long the trails are.

Here, everyone has gotten past the town...
![][past_town]

So, we can prune the trail from before the town...
![][pruning_trail]

And, then shift the remaining cards down to make room.

# Ending the Game

If all the virtual people in your wagon die, then you are out of the game.

First person to reach Oregon wins.  This is done when the 20th trail card is forged.
In counting 20 trail segments, the forts and towns do not count.
Make sure you don't count them when purging old trail cards.

How long a trail it takes to get to Oregon can be adjusted for length of game, but 20 trail cards is a good starting point.
