  <td>When the calamity is played on you, immediately roll the die.  On a 4, 5, or 6 the calamity is discarded and does 
  not affect you.  On a 1, 2, or 3 you receive the calamity and cannot use the "Forge a New Trail" action until it is 
  mended.  If you don't mend the calamity on your next turn (however many actions you have) your entire wagon party dies and you are 
  out of the game.  The calamity can be mended by a spare parts supply or as the action of arriving in a town. </td>

  <td>You cannot use the "Forge a New Trail" action until it is mended.  If you don't mend the calamity on your next
  turn (however many actions you have) your entire wagon party dies and you are out of the game.  The calamity can be 
  mended by an oxen supply or as the action of arriving in a town.<br>
  Oxen can't die twice. If you get two Dead Oxen calamities played on you, you only have to mend the calamity once.
  The redundant ones can be discarded as having no effect. This includes the Inadequate Grass and Bad Water cards.  You can
  have both those calamities on you, but when they turn into a "dead oxen" problem, then they are redundant with any
  other Dead Oxen calamity or calamity that has now killed your oxen. Basically, when you get to your turn, if you have
  dead oxen you can mend it with one action (whether playing an oxen supply card or using the mend a calamity action of a town).
  All the dead oxen effects are removed with one shot.<br>
  In a worst case scenario where you have had two dead oxen cards and a second inadequate grass and a second bad water calamity
  played on you in one round, then when it comes to your turn, you have six calamity cards on you that each individually
  cause "dead oxen". But, you discard 5 of them for free and only have to mend the dead oxen problem once.  They simply
  died of six causes at once, but are replaced just as easily as oxen that die of only a single card.<br>
  As a final note, the directions on the card are confussing because they specifically refer to 2 oxen dying as if you were
  counting up a specific number of oxen. Ignore the "2." Your wagon is being pulled by 2 oxen, that's why it says "2."
  They die and are restored as a unit. It's just either "dead oxen" or "live oxen."</td>

 <tr><td><img src="images/inadequate_grass.jpg"></td>
  <td>Has no effect as long as the other Inadequate Grass card is not played on someone.  It can only be mended by the 
  "remove a calamity" action in a town.  If the other Inadequate Grass card comes up, both players, including the 
  one that just got the calamity now have dead oxen. The calamity now works exactly like the dead oxen calamity (see 
  above).  You cannot forge new trail and it can be mended with an oxen supply card. Note that the inadequate grass 
  calamity cannot be mended with an oxen supply card, but once it becomes a dead oxen problem, then it can be. If you get
  both Inadequate Grass calamities played on you, you have redundantly dead oxen. You only need to mend "dead oxen" once
  to discard both calamities.</td>

 <tr><td><img src="images/bad_water.jpg"></td>
  <td>Has no effect as long as the other Bad Water card is not played on someone.  It can be mended by a Clean Water 
  supply or as the action of arriving in a town.  If the other Bad Water card comes up, both players, 
  including the one that just got the calamity now have dead oxen. The calamity now works exactly like the dead oxen 
  calamity (see above).  You cannot forge new trail and it can be mended with an oxen supply card. Note that the bad 
  water calamity can be mended by clean water, but once it becomes a dead oxen problem then you need an oxen supply
  card, not a clean water supply card. If you are the player that gets the second Bad Water card, then you have redundantly
  dead oxen. You only need to mend "dead oxen" once to discard both calamities.</td>
  <td><img src="images/clean_water.jpg"></td></tr>

 <tr><td><img src="images/measles.jpg"></td>
  <td>On your first turn after receiving the Measles calamity, you have one fewer action to use unless you mend the calamity.
  Meaning, if you had 4 actions then you would have only 3 actions unless you used one of those actions to play a Medicine
  card and cure the Measles.  If you have only 1 action, then you have 0 actions for that turn and can take no action (you
  lose your turn), there is no option to avoid it because you have no other actions to use.  Other than the loss of an
  action on that first turn, the Measles has no effect on you until the other Measles card comes up.  If you have not
  mended the calamity by then, both you and the other player lose a wagon member (and therefore an action) permanently.
  If you have received both Measles cards, then you lose two wagon members.
  The player that gets the second Measles card does not have a temporarily reduced action count for their first
  turn on top of this. The wagon member with measles has simply died.  At this point the measles cards are discarded.
  You can mend Measles with a Medicine supply, whether on your first turn after receiving it or later.</td>

 <tr><td><img src="images/typhoid.jpg"></td>
  <td>If you do not cure the Typhoid calamity on the first turn after receiving it, 
  you lose one of the people in your wagon. To mend it, you need 1 clean water supply and 1 medicine supply.
  After that turn you will discard the calamity card (either because you mended it or because its effect is complete).</td>
  <td><img src="images/medicine.jpg">&nbsp;<img src="images/clean_water.jpg"></td></tr>

 <tr><td><img src="images/cholera.jpg"></td>
  <td>Has no ill effect on you until the other Cholera card comes up. To mend it, use 2 medicine cards.  If the other 
  Cholera card is played on any player before you have mended this one, 
  then you lose a person from your wagon, and the other player that just received the second Cholera card (whether that 
  is you or another player) also loses a person from their wagon.  At this point the Cholera cards are discarded.</td>

 <tr><td><img src="images/dysentery.jpg"></td>
  <td>You lose one virtual person from your wagon.  Nothing to do about it. Immediately deduct the wagon member and discard the card.</td>

 <tr><td><img src="images/starvation.jpg"></td>
  <td>You have two turns to mend it.  If 
  you do not, you lose one of the people in your wagon.  To mend it, you need a food supply.
  After the second turn, mark the wagon member dead and discard the calamity card.</td>

 <tr><td><img src="images/extreme_cold.jpg"></td>
  <td>If you do not mend this calamity on your next turn after receiving it, 
  you lose one of the people in your wagon. To mend it, you need a clothing supply.
  After that turn, if not mended, mark the wagon member dead and discard the calamity card.</td>
  <td><img src="images/clothes.jpg"></td></tr>

 <tr><td><img src="images/broken_arm.jpg"></td>
  <td>For your next two turns you have one fewer actions than you have people in your wagon.  If you only had one
  person in your wagon this means you can't do anything on your next two turns. After those two turns, discard the
  calamity card.</td>
  <td></td></tr>

 <tr><td><img src="images/thief.jpg"></td>
  <td>The player you selected for the calamity must fan out their supply cards and allow you to draw one at random.  
  Except, if they have the bullets supply card, they can instead show that to you and discard it and then the roles get
  reversed and they get to steal a card from you. If you also have a bullets supply card, then you can show and discard
  it and flip the situation back around to stealing from them. This could continue except that there are only two
  bullets cards.  You can't trade a supply for bullets.  Discard the calamity card as soon as the theiving is resolved.</td>

 <tr><td><img src="images/hunting.jpg"></td>
  <td>If you have a bullets supply card you can discard it and place this card in your supply deck to use as
  if it were a food supply. But, when it is used, place it in the calamity discard pile, not the supply bank.
  If you do not have bullets, or don't want to use them, then this calamity has no 
  effect. You can't trade a supply for bullets.</td>
