# Oregon Trail Race

These are completely alternate rules for the Oregon Trail card game which significantly improve its playability.  With these rules it is a competitive, rather than a cooperative, game and  involves a little more strategy, though there is still a fair amount of chance in the gameplay.  These new set of rules work with the supplies in the original game.

The only thing that needs to be added are player markers.  So, grab your Monopoly set or any other game and borrow some player markers.  Anything that is not larger than half the size of the cards and is unique for each player will work.

Each player is driving their own separate wagon on their own trail to Oregon.  Each player starts with 4 virtual people in their wagon.  If all your people die, you are out of the game.  The first player to successfully navigate their wagon to Oregon (and mend any calamities) wins.  The length of the road to Oregon can be adjusted to make the game longer or shorter.  20 to 25 trail segments is a good number, just agree ahead of time.

# [Rules]
See the [rules] for complete explanation.  The basics are that you are each separately driving a wagon to Oregon with 4 people in the wagon.  Each turn you take an action for each of your wagon members and the first person to Oregon wins.  River cards must be forded by you, but calamity trail cards allow you to play calamities on other players.

Actions:
   * Draw a trail card
   * Play a trail card
   * Play supply cards to mend a calamity
   * Move one step along your already forged trail
   * Remove any calamity (when in a town / fort)
   * Draw a supply card (when in a town / fort)
   * Attempt to ford a river (if stuck in one, in which case no other actino can be taken)

In general, each player plays like they are conducting their own private game of the original cooperative game, but the original rules leave some holes and some parts need to be adapted, so do refer to the full [rules] for more details.
