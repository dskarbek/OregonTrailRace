# Oregon Trail Race

These are completely alternate rules for the Oregon Trail card game which significantly improve its playability.  With
these rules it is a competitive, rather than a cooperative, game and  involves a little more strategy, though there is
still a fair amount of chance in the gameplay.  This new set of rules works with the supplies in the original game.

Each player is driving their own separate wagon on their own trail to Oregon.  Each player starts with 4 virtual people
in their wagon.  If all your people die, you are out of the game.  The first player to successfully navigate their wagon
to Oregon wins.

# [Rules]
See the [rules] for complete explanation.  The basics are that you are each separately driving a wagon to Oregon with 4
people in the wagon.  Each turn you take an action for each of your wagon members and the first person to Oregon wins.  
River cards must be forded by you, but calamity trail cards allow you to play [calamities] on other players.

Actions:
   * Draw a trail card
   * Play a trail card or finish fording a river
   * Play supply cards to mend a calamity
   * Move one step backwards or forwards again along your already forged trail
   * Use the action of a fort or town that you are at or have in your hand (by placing it).

In general, each player plays like they are conducting their own private game of the original cooperative game, executing one "round" of play on each turn.
But the original rules leave some holes and some parts need to be adapted, so do refer to the full [rules] for more details.
