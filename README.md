# Oregon Trail Race

These are completely alternate rules for the Oregon Trail card game which significantly improve its playability.  With these rules it is a competitive, rather than a cooperative, game and  involves a little more strategy, though there is still a fair amount of chance in the gameplay.  These new set of rules work with the supplies in the original game.

The only thing that needs to be added are player markers.  So, grab your Monopoly set or any other game and borrow some player markers.  Anything that is not larger than half the size of the cards and is unique for each player will work.

Each player is driving their own separate wagon on their own trail to Oregon.  Each player starts with 4 virtual people in their wagon.  If all your people die, you are out of the game.  The first player to successfully navigate their wagon to Oregon (and mend any calamities) wins.  The length of the road to Oregon can be adjusted to make the game longer or shorter.  20 to 25 trail segments is a good number, just agree ahead of time.

# [Rules]
See the [rules] for complete explanation.  The basics are that you are each separately driving a wagon to Oregon with 4 people in the wagon.  Each turn you take an action for each of your wagon members and the first person to Oregon wins.  River cards must be forded by you, but calamity trail cards allow you to play calamities on other players.

Actions:
   * Draw a trail card
   * Play a trail card
   * Play supply cards to mend a calamity
   * Move one step along your already forged trail
   * Remove any calamity (when in a town / fort)
   * Draw a supply card (when in a town / fort)
   * Attempt to ford a river (if stuck in one, in which case no other actino can be taken)

In general, each player plays like they are conducting their own private game of the original cooperative game, but the original rules leave some holes and some parts need to be adapted, so do refer to the full [rules] for more details.

Pull requests are welcomed!  Help me refine these rules by play testing them and if you want to suggest changes to the rules, please submit PRs for what you would change.  If you have questions about the rules as written, submit an issue against this repo and I will try to clarify what is unclear.

# Proposed Changes
## More actions per turn
Allow each player to take as many actions as they have wagon members on each turn.  This would allow you to have what feels like a more substantial turn.  Then the calamities that talk about "one round of play" would still be just that -- one turn for you, which is N actions.  Might need some technicalities around wining the race if two players reach oregon on the same round -- winner should be who go there with fewer actions in that last round?  Although, that may not actually be the person that got there with the fewest actions over-all.  Someone who loses a wagon member early really does move slower.  This may be just fine.  It would put more "teeth" on losing wagon members and then we just say first one there is first one there.

## Don't require a calamity free wagon to win
If you want to risk running with un-mended calamities, that is your gamble.  First to Oregon wins, doesn't matter if they come in hobbling or not.

## Revert Town and Fort to original behavior
Strike the "buy supplies" and "mend any calamity" actions and just say that towns give you 1 supply card OR remove one calamity as printed, and that forts give you 2 supply cards, as printed.  But, will keep the rule that you can go back and visit a town or fort again, and when in a town / fort you can "re-activate" the town / fort action as one of your actions.  Should still be able to skip a fort / town.  Not sure if we need an incentive for the player that places the town / fort since everyone gets to use it.  Maybe just controlling when it is placed is incentive enough.

I want loading up on supplies to be a more important strategy.  Maybe just the limiting of calamity healing abilities of a fort is enough to do that.

Perhaps play supplies open deck, like a bank.  You can pick which ones you get, that seems better.
