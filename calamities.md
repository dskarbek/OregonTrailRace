![](/images/broken_tongue.jpg) ![](/images/broken_axle.jpg) ![](/images/broken_wheel.jpg) | When the calamity is played on you, immediately roll the die.  On a 4, 5, or 6 the calamity is discarded and does not affect you.  On a 1, 2, or 3 you receive the calamity and can no longer use the "Forge a New Trail" action.  You have as many turns as you have people in your wagon to mend the calamity or your entire wagon party dies and you are out of the game.  The calamity can be mended by a spare parts supply, or by going back to the last town and using the "Mend Any Calamity" action in a fort / town. | ![](/images/spare_parts.jpg)
![](/images/dead_oxen.jpg) | You can no longer use the "Forge a New Trail" action, and you have as many turns after receiving this calamity as there are people in your wagon to mend it.  If you do not, your entire wagon party dies and you are out of the game.  To mend it, you need 1 oxen supply, or use the "Mend Any Calamity" action in a fort / town. | ![](/images/oxen.jpg)
![](/images/inadequate_grass.jpg) | Has no effect as long as the other Inadequate Grass card is not played on someone.  It can only be mended by the "Mend Any Calamity" action in a town / fort.  If the other Inadequate Grass card comes up, both players, including the one that just got the calamity now have dead oxen.  You both can no longer use the "Forge a New Trail" action, and you each have as many turns after receiving this calamity as there are people in your respective wagons to mend it.  If you do not, your entire wagon party dies and you are out of the game.  To mend it, you need 1 oxen supply, or use the "Mend Any Calamity" action in a fort / town. | ![]()
![](/images/bad_water.jpg) | Has no effect as long as the other Bad Water card is not played on someone.  It can be mended by a Clean Water supply or the "Mend Any Calamity" action in a town / fort.  If the other Bad Water card comes up, both players, including the one that just got the calamity now have dead oxen.  You both can no longer use the "Forge a New Trail" action, and you each have as many turns after receiving this calamity as there are people in your respective wagons to mend it.  If you do not, your entire wagon party dies and you are out of the game.  To mend it, you need 1 oxen supply, or use the "Mend Any Calamity" action in a fort / town. | ![](/images/clean_water.jpg)
![](/images/measles.jpg) | If you have a medicine supply card (or successfully "trade" for one), then you can discard this calamity (and the supply card) as soon as it is given to you without it costing you a turn to deal with.  If you are trading supply cards to do this (because you don't have a medicine supply card) and the trade fails, you can try again if you want until you succeed or run out of supply cards.<br>If you don"t avoid the calamity when it is given, then you lose your next turn.  On any turn after that, you can mend the calamity with a medicine supply or by using the "Mend Any Calamity" action at a fort / town.  If the other Measles card is played on any player before you have mended this one, then you lose a person from your wagon, and the other player that just received the second Measles card (whether that is you or another player) also loses a person from their wagon unless they successfully deflect the calamity with a medicine card (or trading for a medicine card). | ![](/images/medicine.jpg)
![](/images/typhoid.jpg) | You have as many turns after receiving this calamity as there are people in your wagon to mend it.  If you do not, you lose one of the people in your wagon.  To mend it, you need 1 clean water supply and 1 medicine supply, or use the "Mend Any Calamity" action in a fort / town. | ![](/images/medicine.jpg) ![](/images/clean_water.jpg)
![](/images/cholera.jpg) | Has no ill effect on you until the other Cholera card comes up.  To mend it, use 2 medicine cards or the "Mend Any Calamity" action at a fort / town.  If the other Cholera card is played on any player before you have mended this one, then you lose a person from your wagon, and the other player that just received the second Cholera card (whether that is you or another player) also loses a person from their wagon. | ![](/images/medicine.jpg)

![](/images/theif.jpg) | The player you selected for the calamity must fan out their supply cards and allow you to draw one at random.  Except, if they have the bullets supply card, they can instead show that to you and discard it and then you don't get anything.  (Potential variants: you show the bullets but keep them, or you discard the bullets and don't get stolen from, but the thief also dies, meaning that the player that played the calamity on you loses a member of their wagon party.) | ![](/images/bullets.jpg)
![](/images/hunting.jpg) | If you have a bullets supply card you can discard it and collect a food supply card from the supply deck.  After doing so, reshuffle the supply deck.  If you do not have bullets, or don't want to use them, then this calamity has no effect. | ![](/images/bullets.jpg)
